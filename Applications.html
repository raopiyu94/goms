					<h2>Introduction</h2>
	       
					<p>
The number of documents mentioned in this website are approximate and more than enough for applying 10 universities.
Scan all the documents mentioned in sections below and save them in .pdf or .docx format (preferably .pdf) in a folder named “GO MS” in your PC, on desktop so that they are handy.
For all the hard copies, purchase a good harmonium folder to store all documents in a properly segregated manner.

</p>

					<h1>Marksheets</h1>
						       
					<ul>
					   <li>Scan your original set of mark sheets in a single pdf document. (Majority of the documents that you will upload during applications must be in pdf format).</li>
					   <li>Photocopy 10 sets of your mark sheets and keep them properly in harmonium folder.</li>
					   <li>Get them attested from HOD/dean/registrar of your respective department. (Preferably HOD)</li>
					   <li>Since few universities in USA require undergraduate university attested marksheets. Keep 5 spare sets of mark sheets and get them attested from student’s forum of your respective university.</li>
					   <li>Scan HOD attested mark sheets in a pdf file and save it in a new folder named “GO MS”.</li>
					   <li>Similarly also scan university attested marksheets and save it.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Transcripts</h1>
						       
					<ul>
					   <li>Transcripts are basically year wise mark sheets printed on college’s letterhead, attested by the undergraduate college authorities.</li>
					   <li>You need to ask your college office or exam section to verify your original mark sheets and accordingly give you transcripts.</li>
					   <li>Get 10 sets of transcripts (attested photocopies) and at least 1 original.</li>
					   <li>Sometimes there are many engineering colleges under a university so you need to also attest photocopies of your transcripts along with your university student’s forum.</li>
					   <li>Scan the set of original transcript, attested college photocopy and attested university photocopies and save each set individually in pdf format in “Go MS” folder.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Making Sets</h1>
						<p>Club a set of HOD attested mark sheets and a set of college attested transcripts together in an envelope, seal it properly and get the flaps stamped and signed from college.<br><blockquote><strong>Note: Keep atleast one set of mark sheets and transcripts unsealed in case of emergency</strong></p></blockquote>      
					
					<h1>Letters of Recommendation (LOR)</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>They are basically letters written by your professors to universities which you are applying to convey them your genuine merit.</li>
					   <li>Usually LORs are written on college letterhead but personal letterheads of professors is also acceptable.</li>
					   <li>They mention about your achievements, c.g.p.a./percentage, extra-curricular and co-curricular activities. Also years of association between recommender and student.</li>
					   <li>Usually universities demand 3 LORs, if you are a fresher, all the 3 LORs must be taken from undergraduate university professors or associate professors. (One of them must be your final year project guide)</li>
					   <li>If you have been working for some company, 1 LOR must be from your employer describing your accomplishments in the company and remaining 2 LORs from your undergraduate college professors. (Preferably one from your final year project guide)</li>
					   <li>Professors/ Employers need to sign at the end of LOR.</li>
					   <li>Scan all the LORs individually, make a pdf file and save with names or initials of the recommenders in “GO MS”.</li>
					   <li>Put these LORs in separate envelopes, seal the envelopes and take signs of the recommenders on flaps of the envelopes.</li>
<blockquote><strong>Note: Do not interchange envelopes, signs or do any mistake in making sets of lor as it maybe considered as forgery. Also write “LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION 1” for all letters from a professor and so on, on every lor so as to avoid confusion while filling online application forms.</strong></blockquote>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Statement of Purpose(SOP)</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>This is a document which conveys universities your fields of interests and background. </li>
					   <li>Basically, you have to describe your purpose to apply to that particular university and also what edge does your application have over other applicants</li>
					   <li>Your SOP must mention your master’s field and concentration, also it must have university name and the semester (eg- fall 2016, spring 2017) mentioned on it.</li>
					   <li>Do not send SOP mentioning some university name to some other university or else your application will be directly discarded. (Common mistake)</li>
					   <li>Do not copy your SOP from any search engine or previous applicants as it is already recorded by the universities and if your SOP matches any of those, then your application will be discarded because of plagiarism.</li>
					   <li>Each university has their own requirements for number of words in SOP, read it carefully and alter your document accordingly.</li>
					   <li>Preferably, start your SOP with some good proverb.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Small Essays</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>Many universities ask you to frame small essays as answers for questions asked on application form</li>
					   <li>These universities mostly don’t ask for SOPs but refer these small essays instead</li>
								   
					</ul>
					<a href="small_essay.html" class="btn btn-primary">Click for few examples of small essays</a>
					
					<h1>Letters of recommendation (LOR)</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>Resume in US universities is taken very seriously</li>
					   <li>Resumes must not have any spelling or grammatical error</li>
					   <li>They need to be decent and without any photographs and cliparts.</li>
					   <li>Also resume must not be more than 1 page long</li>
					   <li>Take 10 printouts of your resume and save in your computer in .pdf fromat</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Passport</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>Take atleast 10 photocopies of your passport front and last page</li>
					   <li>Also scan them and make a pdf document and save it in "Go MS" folder</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Bank Letter</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>Before getting bank letter you must know which is the costliest university you are applying out of the 10?</li>
					   <li>You must show approximately 1.5 times the amount needed by that university per year in your bank in form of liquid funds (Savings, FDs, PF etc)</li>
					   <li>Usually companies that provide you with loan give you a copies of bank letter for the amount you desire, you must consult them for bank letter’s scanned copy as well.</li>
					   <li>Save the clear scanned copy in GO MS folder in .pdf format</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Affidavit</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>Affidavit is a declaration on stamp paper from parents (whose name the bank letter states as owner of money) that he/she is ready to spend it on your education.</li>
					   <li>Format of affidavit is as shown:</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote><pre>
This is to certify that We, Mr. (Father’s name) and Mrs. (Mother’s name) will undertake the educational expenses for (your name), for pursuing his Masters of Science in (concentration/ field/ department) at (university name) U.S.A. until the completion of the course.
 
We understand liability incurred is approximately US $*****/- per annum.
 
We are submitting this affidavit of support to assure you of credibility of our financial position.
Sincerely,
(Signatures)
 
 
(Notary stamp of govt.)
</pre></blockquote>
					<h1>GRE, TOEFL and IELTS mark sheets</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>Keep scanned pdf copies of all the scores in “GO MS” folder handy</li>
					   <li>Print 10 copies of TOEFL or IELTS marksheet</li>
					   <li>Edit GRE marksheet so as to hide the names of universities you applied after your exam was over, print 10 copies of the rest of the result. (It is fine if you don’t edit the mark sheet)</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Application fees receipt</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>After you pay for every application you make, remember print the payment receipt</li>
					   <li>It is better to mail it with the packet to university as they get clear reference about you analysing that receipt</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Extra/Co-curricular</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>Make 10 sets of photocopies of all your significant achievements and certificates in extra/ co-curricular activities</li>
					   <li>They do not matter very much unless you have patents or many published papers on your name but they do put a positive impression on the selector and increases your possibility to get selected in a university</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h1>Cover Letter</h1>
					<ul>
					   <li>It is another important document. It is like an index for packets mailed to university</li>
					   <li>It mentions all the documents we have mailed to university and it thus changes from university to university</li>
					   <li>You have to mention date, address of university, semester in which you are going to US and your name along with the list of all the documents which you are submitting to the university via that packet</li>
					   <li>Save it in .docx format since it has to be changed for every university you apply</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Few Important tips</h3>
					<ol>
					   <li>Student visa is known as F1 visa and working visa is H1</li>
					   <li>Do not state anything in your form which is not justified by transcripts, certificates etc</li>
					   <li>Bachelor’s degree is known as undergraduate degree and master’s degree is also known as graduate degree so don’t get confused</li>
					   <li>Masters in Engineering and Masters of Science are 2 different degrees</li>
					   <li>If you know your percentage and not your average GPA or grade, try to avoid writing it. If it is compulsory to write your GPA, here is the table to convert your percentage or pointers to GPA</li>
